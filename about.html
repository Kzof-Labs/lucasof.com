            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is <strong>Lucas Maciel de Campos</strong>, I'm a brazilian software developer and 
                computer science enthusiast who likes complex and low-level areas such as
                compilers, chess engines, game engines, and more.
            </p>

            <p>I started graduating in <strong>SÃ£o Paulo State Technological Colleges</strong> in 2024,
                but my contact with programming started early on in 2015, when my father teached me the 
                basics of programming and my first language, <strong>Visual Basic.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Later on I decided to learn C# and make games using the Unity Game Engine, until
                I started to study how game engines worked under the hood, and then make my own.
            </p>

            <p>Today I'm interested in areas that are more low level, I began to study how
                compilers and programming languages worked, chess engines, etc.
